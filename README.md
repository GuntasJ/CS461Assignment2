# CS461Assignment2
Assignment for CS461: Genetic Algorithm


For this assignment, I assumed that each section could have its points only applied once in total. Meaning instead of adding 0.5 4 times, it can only be added once. 


This puts the theorteical max fitness at 13, by summing up all the positive numbers in the fitness criteria. The highest working max I saw was 12.75, by running the 
program for a lot longer and using a higher initial population
